# Spring-data-jpa
This repository demonstrates the use of Spring Data JPA for building a simple CRUD application. The project uses Spring Boot to set up the application with minimal configuration and showcases features like:
1. CRUD operations using JpaRepository
2. Custom query methods and derived queries
3. Pagination and sorting functionality
4. Integration with H2 (in-memory) and MySQL databases (configurable)
5. Service and REST controller layers for handling business logic and API requests
